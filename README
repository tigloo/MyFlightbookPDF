This is a very simple PDF exporter for MyFlightbook.com.

It processes MyFlightbook's CSV files and turns them into a LateX file. The code is meant to be integrated into the website (although it can run just fine stand-alone at the moment). Some changes are needed during integration depending on the server setup, so consider this to be a preliminary version.

Usage:
logbook.py <CSV file>

<CSV file> is the name of the exported CSV file from Myflightbook.com. Output is sent to stdout as LateX code. Use pdfLatex to generate a PDF.
