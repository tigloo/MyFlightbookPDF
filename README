This is a very simple PDF exporter for MyFlightbook.com.

It processes MyFlightbook's CSV files and turns them into a LaTeX file. The code can be deployed to an OpenShift instance as-is and will present a simple web interface there, accepting a CSV file as input and producing a compiled PDF in return.

A second use scenario is the stand-alone usage of logbook.py from the command line. Logbook.py will turn a CSV file into a ready-to-compile TeX file.

Usage:
logbook.py <CSV file>

<CSV file> is the name of the exported CSV file from Myflightbook.com. Output is sent to stdout as LaTeX code. Use xelatex to generate a PDF.

Dependencies:
- TeXLive (or any other TeX distribution that provides xelatex)
- unicodecsv for Python

All dependencies, including any TeX packages, are automatically installed when deploying to OpenShift. When using logbook.py from the command line, these dependencies need to be installed manually. A first run of TeX in interactive mode will help in case of missing packages.
